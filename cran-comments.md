Dear CRAN team,

This is an update of the {snotelr} package (version 1.5.1). This package calculates and visualizes 'SNOTEL' snow data and seasonality. This update implements the correct conversion of snow depth
values to metric, which escaped me during the last release - apologies.

No further changes were made to the package so the update does not affect previous code coverage and testing metrics (which remained the same).

Kind regards,
Koen Hufkens
